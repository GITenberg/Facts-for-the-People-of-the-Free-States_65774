<h2>SOUTHERN SCENES IN 1846.</h2>
</div>


<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<h3 class="break-before">Murder of Slaves.</h3>

<p>The Abbeville (S. C.) Banner
states, that two of Gov. McDuffie’s
slaves were killed on Friday,
Feb. 13th, by two other slaves, acting
in the capacity of <em>drivers</em>!
They were killed by what the law
terms “moderate correction!”</p>


<h3>A Slave Woman attempting Suicide
at Baltimore.</h3>

<p>In June, 1846, the Baltimore
Sun gave an account of a woman
who “jumped out of the window
of the place in which her owner
had confined her, and immediately
took the nearest route to throw
herself into the water.” She was
rescued. But, says the Sun, “Upon being taken upon the deck of the vessel,
she begged the by-standers to let her drown herself, stating, that she would
'sooner be dead, than go back again <em>to be beaten as she had been</em>!’”</p>


<h3>A Slave Suicide effected at Richmond, Va.</h3>

<p>A correspondent of the Philadelphia Inquirer, July 25, 1846, wrote from
Richmond, as follows:&mdash;“An unpleasant occurrence took place in this city yesterday.
A man, who has a number of negroes in his employment, was proceeding,
for a slight offence, to punish one of them by whipping, when the poor
wretch, knowing his master’s unmerciful nature, implored that he might be
<em>hung</em> at once, instead of whipped. This of course would not answer, and on
tying the negro’s hands behind him in the usual manner, the employer went
into another room to procure a cowhide, when the negro, taking advantage of
his master’s absence, rushed from the room, jumped into the river, and was
drowned.”</p>


<h3>Slave Suicide and Slave Hunting in Louisiana.</h3>

<p>In June, 1846, the New Orleans Commercial Times said&mdash;“We learn that a
few days since a negro man, belonging to Captain Newport, of East Baton
Rouge, while closely pursued by the dogs of Mr. Roark, of this Parish, ascended
a tree and hung himself. Mr. Roark, with Captain Newport’s son-in-law and
overseer, were in pursuit of a runaway slave. They did not know that this
negro was out, and were surprised upon their arrival, a few minutes in the rear
of the dogs, to find him suspended by his neck, with his feet dangling only a foot or
two from the earth. Every effort was made to restore animation, but without success,
although on their coming up the body was still warm. The act was one,
it would seem, of resolute predetermination, as the slave was well provided with
cords, which he made use of to perpetrate his suicidal purpose.”</p>


<h3>More Murders of Slaves.</h3>

<p>The Palmyra (Mo.) Courier, in August, 1846, says:&mdash;“We understand that
a gentleman, living in Macon county, while out hunting with his rifle, last
week, came suddenly upon two fugitive slaves, who gave him battle. He shot
one, and split the other’s skull with the barrel of his gun. He then started for
home, but before reaching it he met a man in the road, who inquired if he had
seen or heard of two runaway negroes&mdash;describing them. The gentleman replied,
that he had just killed two, and related the circumstance. On proceeding
to the spot, the stranger identified them as his slaves.”</p>

<h2>THE FUGITIVE SLAVE.</h2>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_003.jpg" alt="Fugitive slave with hat, bag and dog" />
</div>


<h3 class="break-before">A Slave Hunter Killed.</h3>

<p>The following is from the
Washington (Pa.) Patriot of
1846: “We learn that a few
days ago, a fugitive slave from
Maryland was pursued and
overtaken in Somerset county,
in this State by a man named
Holland, a wagoner from Ohio,
who was tempted to the task
by the reward offered, $150.
When they reached McCarty’s
tavern the slave attempted to
escape, but was caught by Holland
while in the act of climbing
a fence. The slave drew a
long knife, which he had concealed
about his person, and
plunged it into Holland’s heart, causing his death instantly. He made good his
escape, immediately pursued by the people of the neighborhood, who at nightfall,
had surrounded him, but in the darkness of the night he eluded their vigilance,
and is now beyond their reach.”</p>


<h3>The Rights of the Fugitive.</h3>

<p>The Hon. J. R. Giddings, in a speech in the House of Representatives, at
Washington, Feb. 18, 1846, said&mdash;“In regard to arresting slaves, we [of the
free States] owe no duties to the master; on the contrary, all our sympathies,
our feelings, and our moral duties, beyond what I have stated, are with the
slave. We will neither arrest him for the master, nor will we assist the master
in making such arrest. I am aware that the third clause of the second section
of the first article of the Constitution was once believed, by some, to impose
upon the people of these free States the duty of arresting fugitive slaves. But
it is now judicially settled that no such obligation rests upon us. Indeed a proposition
to impose upon us such a duty, at the time of framing the Constitution,
was rejected, without a division, by the Convention. We, therefore, leave the
master to arrest the slave if he can; and we leave the slave to defend himself
against the master if he can. We do not interfere between them. The slave
possesses as perfect a right to defend his person and his liberty against the
master as any citizen of our State. Our laws protect him against every other
person, except the master or his agent, but they leave him to protect himself
against them. If he, while defending himself, slays the master, our laws do
not interfere to punish him in any way, further than they would any other person
who should slay a man in actual self-defence. The laws of the slave
State cannot reach him, nor is there any law, of God or man, that condemns
him. On the contrary, our reason, our judgment, our humanity approves the
act; and we admire the courage and firmness with which he defends the ”inalienable
rights with which the God of Nature has endowed him.“ We regard
him as a hero worthy of imitation; and we place his name in the same category
with that of Madison Washington, who, on board the Creole, boldly maintained
his God-given rights, against those inhuman pirates who were carrying him
and his fellow-servants to a worse than savage slave-market.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Another Slave Suicide.</span> “The slave of a farmer in an adjoining county,
(Jefferson,) having been jumped upon and stamped by his master, <em>with spurs on</em>,
so as to cruelly lacerate his face as well as his body, he was found, next morning,
in an adjacent pond or stream of water&mdash;having tied a stone to his own
neck, (as it is said,) and plunged in, for the successful purpose of drowning
himself, under the feelings of desperation caused by the fiendish treatment of
his master!”&mdash;<cite>Balt. Sat. Visiter, Aug., 1846.</cite></p>

<h3>PRESIDENTIAL TESTIMONIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">George Washington.</span>&mdash;“I never mean, unless some particular circumstance
should compel me to it, to possess another slave by purchase: <em>it being among
my first wishes to see some plan adopted by which slavery in this country may be
abolished by law</em>.”&mdash;<cite>Letter to John F. Mercer.</cite></p>

<p>“There is not a man living, who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a
plan adopted for the abolition of it (Slavery); but there is only one proper and
effectual mode by which it can be accomplished, and that is, by the legislative
authority; and this, <em>as far as my suffrage will go, will not be wanting</em>.”&mdash;<cite>Letter to
Robert Morris.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Adams.</span>&mdash;“Great is truth&mdash;great is liberty&mdash;great is humanity; and they
must and will prevail.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Jefferson.</span>&mdash;“The rightful <em>power</em> of all legislation is to declare and
enforce <em>only</em> our <span class="smcap">NATURAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES</span>, and <em>take none of them from us</em>.
No man has a natural right to <em>commit aggressions on the equal rights of another</em>,
and this is <span class="smcap">ALL</span> from which the law ought to <em>restrain him</em>. Every man is under
a natural duty of contributing to the necessities of society, and this is all the
law should enforce upon him. When the laws have declared and enforced all
this, they have fulfilled their functions.”&mdash;“The idea is quite unfounded, that on
entering into society, <em>we give up any natural right</em>.”</p>

<p>“The whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the
most boisterous passions; the most unremitting despotism on the one part, and
degrading submissions on the other. * * And with what execration should
the statesman be loaded, who, permitting one-half the citizens thus to trample on
the rights of the others, transforms those into despots, and these into enemies,
destroys the morals of the one part, and the love of country of the other. For, if a
slave can have a country in this world, it must be any other in preference to
that in which he is born to live and labor for another. * * And can the
liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm
basis, a conviction in the minds of the people, that these liberties are the
gift of God; that they are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed, I
tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that his justice cannot
sleep forever. * * When the measure of the slaves’ tears shall be full;
when their tears shall have involved heaven itself in darkness; doubtless a
God of justice will awaken to their distress, and by diffusing light and liberality
among their oppressors, or, at length by his exterminating thunder, manifest
his attention to things of the world, and that they are not left to the
guidance of blind fatality.”&mdash;<cite>Notes on Virginia.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Madison.</span>&mdash;“It seemed now to be pretty well understood, that the real
difference of interests lay, not between the large and small, but between the

<p><span class="smcap">John Q. Adams.</span>&mdash;“Nay, I may go further, and insist that that (the slave)

effectual abolition of the African Slave Trade</em>, and its ultimate denunciation as

vote on this resolution was 118 ayes and 32 nays; <em>James K. Polk voting in the
negative</em>. (Cong. Deb. vol. 7., p. 850). Mr. Polk, since occupying the presidency,

<h2>BURDENS OF SLAVERY ON THE FREE.</h2>
</div>

<h3>The Presidency.</h3>


<p>Of the fourteen presidential terms, now expired since the formation of the
government, eleven have been filled by slaveholders, one by a “Northern man
with Southern principles,” and only two by Northern men. The present incumbent
is a slaveholder, sworn fully to do his utmost to uphold, and even extend
the abomination; and most terribly he is fulfilling his vow, in the surrender of
free territory in Oregon, and in a war of conquest for slavery in Mexico, at a
cost of millions of dollars and thousands of lives. By holding the Presidency,
slavery controls the cabinet, the diplomacy, the army, and the navy of the
country. The power that controls the Presidency controls the nation. No
Northern President has been allowed to serve more than one term.</p>


<h3>The Vice Presidency.</h3>

<p>The President exercises much of his power by and with the Senate. The
Vice President is, ex-officio, President of the Senate. As such, he has the casting
vote in all questions before that body. For the last twenty years, with one
exception, <em>he has been a slaveholder</em>. From the adoption of the Constitution up
to June 1842, there were 76 elections, in the Senate, of President pro. tem. Of
these the slave States had 60 and the free States 16. Most of the 16 were in the
earlier periods of the government. Mr. Southard was elected in 1842. Previous
to that, no Northern man had received the appointment for <em>thirty</em> years!
so careful were the slaveholders to watch their interests by securing the casting
vote.</p>


<h3>Senate.</h3>

<p>For a long series of years the Senate has been equally divided between the
free and the slave States. In this condition of it, it was a great point with the
slaveholders to secure the casting vote of the Vice Presidency, and right carefully
have they done it. This vote is of less importance now, since, by the
admission of Texas, the balance of power is broken up, and “The Valley of
Rascals,” on any tie vote, now rules the Senate and the nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>


<h3>Department of State.</h3>

<p>The Office of Secretary of State is the most important of any, perhaps, in
the cabinet of the President. As it is the duty of this officer to direct the correspondence
with foreign courts, instruct our foreign ministers, negotiate treaties,
&amp;c.; his station is second only, in importance, to that of the Presidency
itself. Of the 15, who had filled this office up to 1845, the slave States have had
10; the free States 5. The whole number of officers in this department at
Washington, in 1846, is 86. Of these Virginia has 6 and the District of Columbia
45.</p>


<h3>The War Department.</h3>

<p>In 1846, there are, at Washington, 98 officers in this department. Of these,
the District of Columbia has 49&mdash;exactly one half, and Virginia and Maryland
have the balance.</p>

<p>The free States generally have furnished the seamen and the soldiers; the
men to do the fighting and endure the hard knocks, <em>but slavery has taken care
to furnish Southern men for officers</em>. Thus, of 1054 naval officers, New England
has only 172; of the 68 commanders, New England has only 11; of the 328
lieutenants, New England has only 59; of the 562 midshipmen, New England
has only 82; and New England owns nearly half the tonnage of the country.
Of all the officers in the navy in 1844, whether in service or waiting orders,
Pennsylvania, with a free population more than double that of Virginia, had
but 177, while Virginia had 224. In 1842, under Mr. Upshur, of 191 naval
appointments, the slave States had 117; the free States only 73.</p>


<h3>Post Office.</h3>

<p>The greatest opposition to cheap postage is from the South. The reason is
obvious. As multitudes of their Post-routes do not pay for themselves, they
must be paid for, through a system of high postage, by the North, or be given
up. Thus in 1842, the deficit in the Post Office department from the slave
States was $571,000, while the excess over the expenditures in the free States
was $600,000. This went of course to make up the deficiency of the South.
So that in 1842 alone the North paid all its own postage, and $571,000 of postage
for the South. Nor was this all. The whole number of miles of mail
transportation for 1842, was 34,835,991, at an expense of $3,087,796. Of these
miles, the mail was carried 20,331,461, at a cost of $1,508,413, in the free States;
and 14,504,530 miles, at a cost of $1,579,383 in the slave States; that is, it cost
$70,970 more to carry the mail in the slave States than in the free, while it ran
5,826,931 miles less. Under the new system, from official returns, presenting a
comparative view of the postage received at forty-two offices, North and South,
during the third quarter of 1844 and 1845, it appears that while the falling off
at the offices in the free States has not been one third, that at the offices in the
slave States has been more than one half.</p>


<h3>Civil, Diplomatic and Consular Agencies.</h3>

<p>That most of the “spoils” of office, in these departments go to the slaveholders
is well known. The following is the Diplomatic Agency of 1846.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Full Ministers.</span> To <i>Great Britain</i>, Louis McLane; <i>France</i>, William R.
King; <i>Spain</i>, Romulus M. Saunders; <i>Turkey</i>, Dabney S. Carr; <i>Mexico</i>, John
Slidell; <i>Brazil</i>, Henry A. Wise;&mdash;all from slave States; and <i>Russia</i>, R. I. Ingersoll
from Connecticut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charges.</span> <i>Austria</i>, William A. Stiles; <i>Holland</i>, Auguste Davezac; <i>Belgium</i>,
Thomas G. Glenson; <i>The two Sicilies</i>, William H. Polk; <i>Sardinia</i>, Robert
Wickliffe; <i>Portugal</i>, Abraham Rencher; <i>Venezuela</i>, Benjamin G. Shields;
<i>Buenos Ayres</i>, George Harris; <i>Chili</i>, William Crump, all from the slave states,
and from the free States only <i>Denmark</i>, William W. Irwin; <i>Sweden</i>, H. W.
Ellsworth; <i>Central America</i>, B. W. Bidlack; and <i>Peru</i>, A. G. Jewett.</p>

<p>Thus, of the seven full ministers six are from the slave States; and of the
thirteen Charges, <em>nine</em> are from the same; and the four given to Northern men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
are among the most insignificant governments in the world. And this favoritism
of the South has been the policy for years. The civil and consular agencies
are dispensed with a like injustice to the free States. The following, prepared
by Prof. Cleveland, gives the number of persons employed in 1845, in
these several agencies, from a few States, with their salaries, and the number
of free white inhabitants in the same.</p>

<h3>Presidential Electors.</h3>

<p>During the twenty years, ending in 1832, there were six presidential elections.
In these, the South cast 608 electoral votes, but only 41 of them for Northern
candidates. During the twenty years, ending in 1835, there were five presidential
elections, in which the South cast 515 electoral votes, only 11 of which
were for Northern candidates.</p>

<p>In the presidential election of 1844, <em>thirteen</em> free States had 161 electors, and
gave 1,890,884 votes&mdash;<em>one</em> elector to 11,739 votes; while <em>twelve</em> slave States had
105 electors and gave 798,848 votes&mdash;<em>one</em> elector to 6,608 votes. In other terms;
<em>six</em> slave State votes counted as much in choice of President and Vice President
as <em>eleven</em> free State votes. In the same election, Michigan had 5 electors and
gave 56,222 votes, or <em>one</em> elector to 11,244 votes; while Louisiana had 6 electors
and gave 26,865 votes, or <em>one</em> elector to 4,447 votes&mdash;that is, <em>four</em> slaveholding
Louisiana votes were equal to <em>eleven</em> free Michigan votes.</p>


<h3>Federal Representation.</h3>

<p>The present number of the House of Representatives, including Texas is
228. Of these 21 represent slave property. In fixing the ratio of representation,
after the last census, the House adopted that of 50,179. This would have
given a House of 306 members, and the free States a majority of 68. But a
small majority is more easily managed than a large. The Senate rejected that
ratio and sent back the bill with the ratio of 70,680. This reduced the House to
223 and brought down the majority of the free States to the more manageable
number of 47. The effect of the odd number, 680, was to deprive the four
great States of the north, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio,
of one member each, with no corresponding disadvantage to any slave State.
Of this proceeding, even the correspondent of the New York Herald said,&mdash;“The
Senate apportionment has robbed the North of at least one quarter of its
practical influence in the Union, when regarded in its full extent; and the members
of the free States who voted for it, have thus surrendered the rights of their
constituents, and violated their trusts.”</p>


<h3>The House of Representatives.</h3>

<p>The Speaker of the House has the appointment of all committees, and of
course exerts an immense influence in this, as well as other ways, in the legislation
of the country. During 31 of the 34 years, from 1811 to 1845, the speakers
were all slaveholders.</p>


<h3>Judiciary.</h3>

<p>The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of highest appeal in the
nation. Its decision on all questions coming before it is final. Of the 30
judges of this court, the slave States have had 17; the free States 13. The circuits
and salaries are still more unequal and unjust. Vermont, Connecticut,
and New York, with 42 representatives in Congress, and a free population of
over <em>three millions</em>, constitute but one circuit; while Alabama and Louisiana,
with but 11 representatives and a free population of but <em>half</em> a <em>million</em>, consti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>tute
another. So of other circuits. Louisiana, with a free population of
183,959, has one judge at a salary of $3,000; Ohio, with a population of
1,519,461, more than eight times as great as that of Louisiana, has only one
judge, at a salary of $1,000: that is, with eight times as many people to do
business for, he receives one-third as much pay. Arkansas, with a free population
of 77,639, has one judge at a salary of $2,000; New Hampshire, with a
population of 284,573, has but one judge, at a salary of $1,000. Mississippi,
with a free population of 180,440, has one judge, at a salary of $2,500; Indiana,
with a population of 685,863, has but one judge, at a salary of $1,000&mdash;that
is, two-fifths as much pay for doing more than three times the work!</p>


<h3>Surplus Revenue.</h3>

<p>The Surplus Revenue, distributed by the Act of 1836, amounted to 37,468,859
dollars. The slaveholders managed to have it distributed, not, as it should have
been, on the basis of free population, but that of federal representation. Thereby
the South, with a free population of 3,823,289, received $16,058,082,85, while
the North, with a free population of 7,008,451, received but $21,410,777,12. So
that for each inhabitant of the <em>free</em> North, there was received but $3,06; while
for each <em>free</em> person in the South, there was received $4,20; or $1,14 more for
each free person in the South, than for each free person in the North. The
South, by this operation alone, received for her slave representation in Congress,
$4,358,549!</p>


<h3>Revolutionary War.</h3>

<p>In this war,&mdash;New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania,&mdash;seven States&mdash;furnished 172,436
troops and were paid for services, $61,971,167. Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia&mdash;six States&mdash;furnished 59,335
troops, and received $52,438,130. In other terms, the Northern States furnished
about three times the number of troops and received less than one fifth more pay.
In particular States the inequality was far greater.</p>


<h3>The War of 1812.</h3>

<p>The Slaveholders envied the commercial prosperity of the North, and, to
crush it, decreed the war of 1812, under the pretence of defending “free trade
and sailor’s rights;” and one hundred and thirty-seven millions of dollars were
wasted in its prosecution, and $200,000,000 more were lost on sea and land
by Northern merchants and farmers, and then, leaving “free trade and sailor’s
rights” where they were before, they made peace, and demanded a National
Bank and Protective Tariff. And in the prosecution of the war, says <span class="smcap">Alvan
Stewart</span>, Esq, (Address to Abolitionists Aug. 1846)&mdash;“The South placed Major
General Smyth at Buffalo, a slaveholding lawyer of Virginia; Major
General Winder, a slaveholding lawyer of Maryland, at Forty Mile Creek, on
the side of Lake Ontario; Major General Wilkinson, a Louisiana slaveholder,
at the Cedars and Rapids of the St. Lawrence; and Major General Wade
Hampton, the great sugar boiler of Louisiana, and the largest slaveholder in
the United States, (having over 5000 crushed human beings bowing to this
monster and tyrant), was located at Burlington, Vermont, four slaveholding
Generals with their four armies, were stretched out on our northern frontier,
not to <em>take</em> Canada, but to prevent its being taken, by the men of New England
and New York, in 1812, '13 and '14; lest we should make some six or eight
free States from Canada, if conquered. This was treason against Northern
interests, blood and honor. This horrid revelation could have been proved by
General John Armstrong, then Secretary of War, after he and Mr. Madison
quarreled.”</p>


<h3>Florida, Florida War, Removal of the Indians.</h3>

<p>While Florida was in possession of Spain it furnished an asylum for slaves
escaping from the contiguous States. It was therefore bought, at the dictation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of the slaveholders, at an expense of $5,000,000. For the same purpose, and at
the same dictation the late Florida War was waged, and the native Indian
exiled. Of this, the Hon. <span class="smcap">J. R. Giddings</span>, 1845, said,&mdash;“They (the army) captured
460 negroes, who were adjudged slaves by staff officers of the army, to
whom the duty was assigned, and who delivered them over to interminable
bondage. [See House Doc. 52, 3d Sess. 27th Congress.] We have no means
by which we can determine the number of lives sacrificed in that war; but it
may be safely asserted, that the capture of each slave cost the lives of two white
men, and at least $80,000 in cash, the most of which was drawn from the
pockets of the people of the free States. The whole expense of the
war is estimated at $40,000,000. The moral guilt incurred, and the sacrifice
of national character cannot be estimated. Perhaps I ought to add, on the
authority of Gen. Jessup, that bloodhounds were also purchased to act as auxiliaries
to our army, and that bloodhounds, and soldiers, and officers, marched
together under the star-spangled banner, in pursuit of the panting fugitives who
had fled from Southern oppression. [House Doc. 125, 3d Sess. 25th Congress.]
And blood hounds, and soldiers, and officers were paid for from the avails of
Northern industry; while our people were not permitted to petition their servants
to be relieved from such degradation.” One R. Fitzpatrick was employed
to get the blood hounds. He obtained thirty-three, and the cost, including expenses
of bringing to Florida, was $5000. The removal of the Indians from
the several slave States was merely to make room for slavery; and it has cost
at least $50,000,000, and of all these millions the North has had to pay the
largest share.</p>


<h3>Texas and the Mexican War.</h3>

<p>Everybody knows that Texas was annexed and that the war is waged to extend
and strengthen Slavery. The cost of these measures is yet to be ascertained.
There is little doubt that it will exceed rather than fall short of one
hundred millions.</p>


<h3>Bank, Tariff, Southern Bankruptcy, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>The South originated the Bank and the Tariff. When they ceased to work
for its interests, the South abolished both. The sums filched from the North by
these changes of national polity and by Southern bankrupts, seem almost incredible.
$27,000,000, of the capital of the United States Bank was sunk at
the South. $500,000,000, it is estimated, would not more than meet the losses
of the North, in sixty years, from Southern bankruptcy. In fine, there is no
end to these burdens&mdash;this side-wise plunder of the free, by those whose entire
life is a wholesale plunder of the Slave. How long will freemen bear it?</p>

<h3>Buying Church Furniture.</h3>

<p>A runaway slave, in 1841, assigned the following as his reason for not communing
with the church to which he belonged at the South. “The church,”
said he, “had silver furniture for the administration of the Lord’s Supper, to
procure which, they <em>sold my brother</em>! and I could not bear the feelings it produced,
to go forward and receive the sacrament from the vessels which were the
purchase of my brother’s blood.”</p>


<h3>Supporting Churches by Slave Jobbing.</h3>

<p>The Rev. J. Cable, of Indiana, May 20, 1846, in a letter to the Mercer
Luminary, says:&mdash;“I have lived eight years in a slave State, (Va.)&mdash;received
my Theological education at the Union Theological Seminary, near Hampden
Sydney College. Those who know anything about slavery, know the worst
kind is jobbing slavery&mdash;that is, the hiring out of slaves from year to year,
while the master is not present to protect them. It is the interest of the one who
hires them, to get the worth of his money of them, and the loss is the master’s
if they die. What shocked me more than anything else, was the church engaged
in this jobbing of slaves. The college church which I attended, and
which was attended by all the students of Hampden Sydney College and Union
Theological Seminary, held slaves enough to pay their pastor, Mr. Stanton,
<span class="smcap">ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS</span> a year, of which the church members did not pay a cent
(so I understood it). The slaves, who had been left to the church by some pious
mother in Israel, had increased so as to be a large and still increasing fund.
These were hired out on Christmas day of each year, the day in which they
celebrate the birth of our blessed Savior, to the highest bidder. These worked
hard the whole year to pay the pastor his $1000 a year, and it was left to the
caprice of their employers whether they ever heard one sermon for which they
toiled hard the whole year to procure. This was the church in which the professors
of the seminary and the college often officiated. Since the abolitionists
have made so much noise about the connection of the church with slavery, the
Rev. Elisha Balenter informed me the church had sold this <em>property</em> and put the
money in <em>other stock</em>. There were four churches near the college church, that
were in the same situation with this, when I was in that country, that supported
the pastor, in whole or in part, in the same way, viz: Cumberland church,
John Kirkpatrick, pastor; Briny church, William Plummer, pastor, (since Dr.
P. of Richmond;) Buffalo church, Mr. Cochran, pastor; Pisga church, near
the peaks of Otter, J. Mitchell, pastor.”</p>


<h3>Selling Ministers as Slaves.</h3>

<p>At the great Convention, at Cincinnati, in June 1845, Mr. Needham of
Louisville, Ky., said:&mdash;“Sir, in 1844, a Methodist preacher, with regular license
and certificate, was placed in the Louisville jail, as a slave on sale. He
preached in the jail sermons which would have done credit to any white
preacher of the town. He kept a little memorandum in his pocket, in which
he marked the number of persons hopefully converted under his preaching. I
represented his case to leading Methodists in Louisville, and showed them a
copy of his papers which I had taken. <em>Not one of them visited him in his prison.</em>
He said he forgave those who had imprisoned him and were about to sell him.
He was sold down the river, which was the last time I saw him.”</p>


<h3>A Slaveholding D. D. whipping his “b&mdash;h” on Sabbath morning preparatory to
preaching.</h3>

<p>March 28, 1843, in a public address at Cincinnati, the Rev. Edward Smith,
True Wesleyan, of Pittsburgh, stated that he had lived in slave states thirty-two
years; and, speaking of a certain D. D. of his acquaintance, he adds:&mdash;“He
was a slaveholder, and a severe one, too, and often, with his own hands, he applied
the cowhide to the naked backs of his slaves. On one occasion, a woman
that served in the house, committed, on Sabbath morning, an offence of too
great magnitude to go unpunished until Monday morning. The Dr. took his
woman into the cellar, and as is usual in such cases, stripped her from her
waist up, and then applied the lash. The woman writhed and winced under
each stroke, and cried, '<em>Oh Lord!</em> <span class="smcap">Oh Lord!!</span> OH LORD!!!’ The Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
stopped, and his hands fell to his side as though struck with palsy, gazed on the
woman with astonishment, and thus addressed her, (the congregation must pardon
me for repeating his words), 'Hush, you b&mdash;h, will you take the name of
the Lord in vain on the Sabbath day?’ When he had stopped the woman from
the gross profanity of crying to God on the Sabbath day, he finished whipping
her, and then went and essayed to preach that gospel to his congregation, which
proclaims liberty to the captive and the opening of the prison doors to them who
are bound.”</p>


<h3>The Greatest Impediment.</h3>

<p>“We are about to make an announcement,” says the True American, “which
must sound very strange to those whose field of observation is unlike our own:
The greatest impediment to the success of the Anti-Slavery movement in the
slave States is, the opposition to it of those men who profess to have been commissioned
by high Heaven to go abroad and use their efforts for the mitigation
of human misery and the extirpation of human wrong! This assertion, which
appears so monstrous, will not surprise any one who lives among slaveholders.
Our conviction of its truth has been confirmed by extensive observation.”</p>

<h2>RELIGIOUS TESTIMONIES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Archbishop Potter.</span> Some of our wise ones will have it that <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">doulos</i> means
slave. Archbishop Potter, than whom no man was more learned in Grecian
antiquities, in his work on them, published years ago, says, chap. 10, “Slaves,
as long as they were under the government of a master, were called <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">oiketdi</i>;
but <em>after their freedom</em> was granted them, they were <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">douloi</i>, not being like the
former, a part of their master’s estate, but only obliged to some grateful acknowledgments
and small services, such as were required of the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Metoikoi</i>, to
whom they were in some few things inferior.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Younger Edwards</span>, (Pastor of a church in New Haven, and afterwards
President of Union College)&mdash;“Every man who cannot show, that his negro
hath by his voluntary conduct, forfeited his liberty, is obligated <em>immediately to
manumit him</em>. And to hold [such an one] in a state of slavery, is to be every
day guilty of robbing him of his liberty, or of <em>man-stealing</em>&mdash;and fifty years
from this time (1791) it will be as <em>shameful for a man to hold a negro slave, as to
be guilty of common robbery or theft</em>.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Adam Clarke.</span> “Among Christians slavery is an <em>enormity</em>, and a <em>crime</em>
for which <em>perdition</em> has scarcely an adequate state of punishment.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Albert Barnes.</span> “From the whole train of reasoning which I have
pursued, I trust it will not be considered as improper to regard it as a position
clearly demonstrated, that the fair influence of the Christian religion would
everywhere abolish slavery. Let its principles be acted out; let its maxims
prevail and rule in the hearts of all men, and the system, in the language of the
Princeton Repertory, 'would <span class="smcap">SPEEDILY</span> come to an end.’ In what way this is to
be brought about, and in what manner the influence of the church may be made
to bear upon it, are points on which there may be differences of opinion. But
there is one method which is obvious, and which, if everywhere practised,
would certainly lead to this result. It is, <em>for the Christian church to cease all
connection with slavery</em>.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. S. H. Cox, D. D.</span> “The cause of human rights is only the converse
of the cause of human duties; and how pious, or how orthodox, or how heroic,
I should like to know, is he, for whose higher evangelical refinement of sensibility,
this subject of righteousness is too 'delicate’ to be theologized into our
ethics, our creed, or our prayers? Away with such nauseating and hypocritical
affectation, in high places, and low ones, too.”&mdash;<cite>Letter to S. J. May, Auburn,

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
